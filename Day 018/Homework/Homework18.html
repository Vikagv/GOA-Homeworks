    <i>I am ten years old and born in August 26th of 2013.<br>
    I study at Goal_Oriented_Academy_GOA and so far I am really enjoying my time there,
    <br> one of my favourite things about GOA is that you can make <br>
    so many new friends and everyone helps you to learn.<br>
    in Goal_Oriented_Academy you get to learn many diffrent forms <br>
    of coading such as HTML , CSS , JS , Python and more so far I have lernt <br>
    Python and parts on HTML in such a small amount of time. <br>
