        Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions,
        called programs, that computers can follow tp preform tasks. it involves desining
        and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedureds, by writing
        code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level
        programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code,
        which is directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming 
        usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowlage of the 
        application domain, details of programming languagesand generic code libaries, 
        specilised algorithms, and formal logic.

        Axiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirements,
        testing, dubugging (investigatng and fixing problems), implemention of build systems,
        and management of derived artifacts, such as progams' matchine code. While these are 
        sometimes considered programming, often the term software development is used for this
        larger overll process - with the terms programming, implementation, and coding resered for
        the writing and editing of code per se.
