<br>
<i style ="color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.205); font-size:x-large">Architecture is the art and technique of designing and 
    building, as distinguished from the skills associated with construction.[3] It is both the process and the product of 
    sketching, conceiving,[4] planning, designing, and constructing buildings or other structures.[5] The term comes from 
    Latin architectura; from Ancient Greek ἀρχιτέκτων (arkhitéktōn) 'architect'; from ἀρχι- (arkhi-) 'chief' and τέκτων (téktōn)
    'creator'. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art.
     Historical civilisations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.[6]

    The practice, which began in the prehistoric era, has been used as a way of expressing culture by civilizations on all seven 
    continents.[7] For this reason, architecture is considered to be a form of art. Texts on architecture have been written since ancient
    times. Many architects became disillusioned with modernism 
     which they perceived as ahistorical and anti-aesthetic, and postmodern and contemporary architecture developed. Over the years, the 
     field of architectural construction has branched out to include everything from ship design to interior decorating.</i>
