I entered GOA when my sister could not start Goa because she had to focus
on school So at this time I was really interested in coading and is was one of
the many things my school could not provide . When my mum found this out she 
asked me if i wanted to join GOA and because i heard about it a lot before and i 
happy agreed. My favourite thing about GOA so far is that nobody gugdes you
and simply just helps you to learn and understand also I enjoy that although
there are lots of people in Goa you still get lots of help and make lots of 
freinds in the process.
