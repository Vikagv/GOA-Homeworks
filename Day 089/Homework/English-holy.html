<i>Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary is a Georgian Orthodox cathedral in Batumi, Adjara. It represents a cultural
     heritage site of national importance. The temple, built in the early 20th century, has both architectural and artistic value.
<br>
    History
    Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary was built in 1897 by Zubalashvili brothers. The church was built in the Neo-
    Gothic style with three domes. During the Soviet period, the church was closed and converted into a high-voltage laboratory
    <br>
    . Later, the church was transferred to the Georgian Orthodox Church. In 1989, the church was consecrated by Catholicos- Pat
    riarch of Georgia Ilia II. 5000 people were baptized on this day in the church. The priest David Shiolashvili was appointed 
    <br>
    as the head of the church, who was blessed as a chief priest by the Catholicos-Patriarch of Georgia Ilia II on this important day. Today,
     the Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary is the main cathedral of the Diocese of Batumi and Lazeti.</i>
