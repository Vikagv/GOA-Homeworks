    <br>

        <i class="h2">n 1878, the city of Batumi was granted the status of Porto-Franco , and a new stage of its urban development began. At that time
            , there were only two small gardens in Batumi: private property - "Governor's Garden" and "Melet Bagcha", a garden
             planted with funds collected by the residents of Batumi and its surroundings. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]

            The members of the administration of the Batumi district at that time came up with the idea to make a walking boulevard on the seashore, for th
            e implementation of which a budget of 2000 manats was allocated. [ 3 ]

            In order to implement the idea of ​​creating a new park, in 1881, German gardeners-engineers Ressler and Reyer were invited , who started the constr
            uction of Batumi Boulevard in the same year. The replacement of the coarse sandy beach of the Black Sea with imported artificial soil made it very 
            difficult, but the German specialists, working daily, managed to achieve the result. [ 4 ]
            <br>
            At the end of 1884, two alleys were already built in the boulevard, but the city government decided to renew it even more, for which it created a s
            pecial commission. Consuls of France and Belgium at that time were involved in the work of the commission . According to the commission's decision,
            the noble French gardener-decorator Michel Dalfons was appointed as the first head of Batumi Boulevard .
            
            Keeping the park was a big expense for the city for several reasons: in summer and autumn there were several weeks of such heat that it became necess
            ary to artificially water it; There was no soil in the boulevard at all, and the whole area was a thick layer of coarse sand, which is why pits or chan
            nels were made for planting, which were filled with soil brought from the suburbs. [ 5 ] Michel Dalphons used ships from France to Batumi to harvest trees,
             a large part of which was not grown in Georgia before. [ 6 ]
            
            Since 1895, the Black Sea began to recede in the area of ​​the park, thereby increasing the area of ​​the coast and making it possible to arrange new alleys and 
            beaches there [ 7 ] .

            In 1888, Russian Emperor Alexander III visited Batumi with his family. During his stay in Batumi, he was a frequent visitor to Batumi Boulevard and planted trees 
            in one of the alleys together with Prince Nicholas . In honor of Nicholas, in the same period, the boulevard under construction was named "Prince Nicholas Boulevard". [ 8 ]</i>
