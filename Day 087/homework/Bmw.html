    <h1><i><u>All about BMW!</u></i></h1>   
    <br>
    <h2>Welcome to BMW</h2>
    <p>BMW is a symbol of luxury, precision engineering, and innovation in the automotive world. From its iconic designs to its cutting-edge technology, 
     BMW continues to redefine the driving experience.</p> 
     <br>
     <h2>What is BMW?</h2>
     <p>BMW stands for Bayerische Motoren Werke, a German multinational company that manufactures luxury automobiles, motorcycles, and engines. Known for their performance,
         luxury, and cutting-edge technology, BMW vehicles
         are some of the most prestigious and desired in the world.</p>

         <h2>Why is BMW just the best?</h2>
         <p>The high price for a new BMW may be out of reach for some enthusiasts, who may consider buying a used model as an alternative. This is where the reliability 
            and longevity of particular models count. With a back <br>
            catalog spanning more than 100 years, it may be challenging to establish which BMW models hit that sweet spot.</p>
