        History
        The Batumi demonstrative aquarium was opened on the 20th of August, in 1966. Initially, the North pacific pinnipeds, valuable fur otters and Caspian seals 
        were represented in it. The special impression used to make the giant tortoise of the Indian Ocean so-called “false coach”, which weighed about 100kg. The d
        ecorative fish variety impressed the visitors, too. There were up to 60 species of dwellers from the freshwaters, different seas and oceans.<br>
        
        At the time the aquarium represents up to 100 species of fish from Black Sea, Georgian freshwaters and the decorative ones: Common Stingray (Dasyatis Pastinac
        a), Thornback Ray (Raja Clavata), Sand Sole (Solea Nasuta), Mullet (Mugilidae), Long-Snouted Seahorse (Hippocampus ramulosus), Red Mullet( Mullus Barbatus Pont
        icus), Brown Meagre (Sciaena Umbra) and other unique species. What about the exotic species, significant ones are the Amazon Piranha (Serrasalminae), Cichlids (
            <br>
            Cichlidae), south-East Asian fishes: Gouramis (Goramy), Barbus (Cyprinus barbus), Botia Macracantha (Chromobotia macracanthus), Red-Tailed Labeo (Labeo Bico
            lor) and the nicest Discus (Symphysodon).
        At that time it was the first demonstrative dolphinarium in the former Soviet Union. It used to belong to the greatest dolphinariums of the world. At the begin<br>
        ning of the 90-ies due to the difficulties caused by the political-economic situation in the country, the dolphinarium stopped functioning.
